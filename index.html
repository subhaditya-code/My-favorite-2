        <p class="para">I do my hobby in my spare time. I have many hobbies like playing cricket, flying kites, studying, etc. But painting is my favorite hobby. I like to paint different things.

            <br> <br> When I do painting, I am lost in doing it. In the beginning, I wasn't able to do painting properly.

            <br> <br> But now, my painting is very good. My mother and father love my paintings. My mother also helps me with my painting. I have received the first prize in Bharat Sanskrity Utsav, Kolkata, painting competition.
